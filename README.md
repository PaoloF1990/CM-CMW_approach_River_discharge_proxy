# CM-CMW_approach_River_discharge_proxy
 
 This repository contains codes to create a proxy of river discharge using multispectral information from rivers worldwide through Google Earth Engine. It has been created by Paolo Filippucci and Angelica Tarpanelli, from CNR IRPI of Perugia. 

 The code is written in Python and it uses the API of google Earth Engine, together with the following packages:

 numpy, scipy, pandas.
 

 This repository has been developed from the following works:
